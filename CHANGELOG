Skippy changelog

0.5.0 -- "The two-headed monster"
 - Properly unmap mini-windows if their client vanishes
 - New ignoreSkipTaskbar configuration option (general section) to make
   skippy ignore application's requests to hide from the taskbar
 - Fix for weird condition grouping Gimp (and most likely others as well)
 - Escape button closes the Skippy window and restores focus
 - Restore the window stacking order after snapping windows
 - Fixed sticky / omnipresent windows when using a GNOME WM Spec WM.
 - Added "useNETWMFullscreen" boolean to the config's [general] section.
   Set it to false if your WM doesn't handle _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN
   corectly (option doesn't do anything if your WM doesn't support
   this state)
 - In case of Xinerama, show only windows that are at least partially visible
   on the current head (use the new Shift modifier to show windows from all
   heads). Shift / non-shift behaviour can be toggled in ~/.skippyrc by
   setting the 'showAll' option to 'true' in the [xinerama] section.
 - Added basic Xinerama support. Skippy will only show itself on head that
   the mouse is on.

0.4.1 -- "Cleaning up the goo"
 - Tile the root pixmap, if needed
 - Fixed strange problem.. Thanks SuperBFG7
 - In a NETWM environment, only use _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN if it's
   available, otherwise revert to an override redirected window
 - Fixed some (pretty serious) logic errors
 - Added (old) GNOME WM Spec support (works with WindowMaker now, if it was
   compiled with gnome support)
 - Fixed wallpaper (root pixmap) related segmentation faults
 - Fixed segfault on startup (which was easily mistaken for being a problem
   related to a lack of a configuration file)
